      <h2><a href="">My first post</a></h2>
      <p>We've created three div sections here.
The first div element contains the title of our blog â€“ it's a heading and a link
Another two div elements contain our blogposts with a published date, h2 with a post title that is clickable and two
p s (paragraph) of text, one for the date and one for our blogpost..</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>published: 24.03.2018, 12:14</p>
      <h2><a href="">My second post</a></h2>
      <p>Probably you have also noticed that each opening tag is matched by a closing tag, with a / , and that elements are nested
(i.e. you can't close a particular tag until all the ones that were inside it have been closed too).</p>
